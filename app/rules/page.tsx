            <p>Here are some rules of the game:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: Before the game begins, please create a player by going to the Register player tab 
                    and entering your name. You will be assigned a role. <br /> Please do not share your role with anyone else.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Rule 2: There will be one or two overseers who will help with the game and will narrate it.
                <br />It is mandatory to follow their instructions.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Rule 3: For the game to go smoothly please try to listen to the overseers and not talk too loudly with each other
                    since it will make it harder for others to <br /> hear the overseers and for them it makes it hard to explain what is happening in the game
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
